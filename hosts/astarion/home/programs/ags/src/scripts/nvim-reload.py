# tl; dr:
# Every nvim instance has a socket located in /run/user/1000
# (it used to be in /tmp but I don't know why or when that changed)
# This script sends a command to change the nvim theme to every socket.
# This is very specifically tailored to MY custom nvim config.
# The method by which you reload your nvim theme may be different,
# but it should be easy to modify this script to suit your needs.
