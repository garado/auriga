# Cozy v2
Porting my old Awesome config to [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/). Still a heavy WIP and not ready to be used by others.

# Credits
Thanks to [Aylur](https://github.com/Aylur/) for his work on ags - it's incredible. Several things that took me days or weeks to figure out in Awesome have taken less than an hour in ags.
